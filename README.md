Aim: To study and implement C++ 2D Array - Matrices.

Software Used: VS code.

Theory: A 2D array in C++ is a structured collection of elements arranged in rows and columns. It is used to represent matrices, grids, or tabular data. Each element is accessed using two indices: one for the row and one for the column. 

Syntax: 

    data_type array_name[row_size][column_size];

This creates a fixed-size matrix where each cell holds a value of the specified data type. The memory layout of a 2D array in C++ follows row-major order, meaning all elements of a row are stored contiguously before moving to the next row.
To process a 2D array, nested loops are commonly used. The outer loop iterates through rows, and the inner loop through columns. This structure allows systematic access to each element.
2D arrays are useful for performing operations like addition, subtraction, transposition, and searching within matrix-like data. They are foundational in algorithms involving dynamic programming, image processing, and simulations.
